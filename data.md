## Description of the Data:

In our project, we are dealing with two data sets: the SemEval: Affect in Tweets task dataset and the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), both compiled by the organizers of the SemEval task.

### Affect in Tweets Data set:
In our project, we chose to focus on one emotion instead of building individual models for all 4. Therefore, the data we use only concerns tweets for which an intensity rating for "anger" is present. Hence, the data we use is in the format of:

```
< ID >  < Tweet > anger < Intensity Score >
```


### Equity Evaluation Corpus:
